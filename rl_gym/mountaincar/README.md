# Mountain Car

## MountainCar-v0

- A car is on a one-dimensional track, positioned between two "mountains". 
- The goal is to drive up the mountain on the right. 
- However, the car's engine is not strong enough to scale the mountain in a single pass. 
- Therefore, the only way to succeed is to drive back and forth to build up momentum.
- Two reinforcement learning approaches: **Deep Q Networks** & **Policy Gradient**.
